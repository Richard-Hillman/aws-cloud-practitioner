five characteristics of cloud computing 

      on demand full self service 

broad network access

multi-tenancy and resource pooling 

rapid elasticity and scalability 

measured service 



dont own hardware 

massive economies of scale (more people using means cheaper)

stop guessing capacity (automatic scaling)

increase speed and agility

stop spending on running and maintaining 

global scaling in minutes (high availability and agility) 



Types of cloud computing



On premises- (app, data, runtime, middleWare, o/S, visualization, servers, storage, networking) 



IaaS- Infrastructure as a Service (app, data, runtime, midW, o/s)

(amazon ec2, GCP, Azure, Rackspace, digital Ocean, Linode) 

Paas-Platform as a Service (app, data)

(elastic Beanstalk on AWS , Heroku, Google app engine, windows azure  

SaaS- Software as a Service (everything managed by cloud service) 

(many aws services, google apps)



Paying 

Compute - pay for compute time

storage- pay for data stored in the cloud 

data transfer- pay for data leaving (data transfer in is free) 



pay only what you need 



AWS cloud facts 

gartner magic quad 

Aws in the lead 

microsoft 

google 



AWS Region - cluster of data centers

govt compliance 

proximity 

available services 

pricing varies region to region



availability zones are separate in a region 

they allow for redundancy 

all connected to form region 



Cloud Services

IAM- global service 

EC2- regional service 


Shared responsibility model
